Project that uses proteowizard and OpenMS.

This code assumes that you have successfully built proteowizard and OpenMS.
Tested on Linux so far.

Please edit the CMakeLists.txt and add the paths to your pwiz build (this
cannot be detected automatically by cmake yet). The relevant lines to change
are:

set(PWIZ_BUILDNAME "build-linux-x86_64")
set(PWIZ_MAKEDIR "/gcc-4.6/release/link-static/runtime-link-static/threading-multi/")

Next, configure cmake with 
 -DOpenMS_DIR=/path/to/OpenMS/cmake and 
 -DPWIZ_MAINDIR=/path/to/pwiz_trunk/pwiz
